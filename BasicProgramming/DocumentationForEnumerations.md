# Exercise 13: Documenting Enumerations

For this exercise, you will document an enumeration in the form of a JavaScript constant object. 
Letâ€™s say we were creating a Learning Management System. 
There is an enumeration to cover the roles that users can be in: 
student, teacher, assistant teacher, and administrator. 

const Role = {
   Student: 0,
   AssistTeacher: 1,
   Teacher: 2,
   Admin: 3
};
