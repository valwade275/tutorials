# About Valerie's "Tutorials" Repo

This repository holds draft files that I use for tutorials and practice exercises.  
As an experienced technical writer, I am familiar with various programming languages, but I am taking time to refocus on the basics and to build some things of my own from scratch.  
Here's to learning out loud. Enjoy!
